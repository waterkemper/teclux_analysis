# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root. It points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context; read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** for system-wide decisions that touch the area you're about to work in.
- Context-scoped `docs/adr/` directories identified by `CONTEXT-MAP.md`.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a multi-context repository, indicated by `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root:

    /
    ├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
    ├── docs/adr/              ← system-wide decisions
    ├── delphi/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/          ← context-specific decisions
    ├── laravel/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/
    └── modules/
        └── ...

The exact context locations are defined by `CONTEXT-MAP.md`.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
